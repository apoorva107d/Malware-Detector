# Malware-Detector
This project develops a malware detection system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet effective machine learning technique. The system is designed to identify and classify malware by analyzing patterns and behaviors in software code. By training the KNN model on a dataset of labeled benign and malicious files, the system can predict the likelihood of new, unseen software being malware. This approach aims to achieve high accuracy in detecting various types of malware, including viruses, trojans, and ransomware, while minimizing false positives. The project can be a valuable addition to cybersecurity tools, offering a data-driven solution to combat emerging threats.
