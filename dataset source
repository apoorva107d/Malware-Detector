The TUNADROMD dataset, available on Kaggle, is designed for Android malware detection. It contains a substantial number of instances (4,465) and attributes (241) to facilitate the classification of Android applications into malware or benign categories. The target column, 'Label', distinguishes between 'malware' and 'goodware' (benign). The dataset is structured to aid in the development and evaluation of machine learning models for malware detection.
